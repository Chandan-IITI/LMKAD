To execute above codes, simply open the above codes in MATLAB and run Main.m file. This code will generate results for Gaussian-Polynomial-Polynomial and Gaussian-Polynomial-Linear combination using linear sigmoid gating function for LMKAD. By changing the parameters, you can obtain the results for other combination of kernel and gating function.
