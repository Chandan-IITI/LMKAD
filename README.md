Author: Chandan Gautam, Ramesh Balaji, K. Sudharsan, Aruna Tiwari, and Kapil Ahuja


To execute above codes, simply open the above codes in MATLAB and run Main.m file. This code will generate results for Gaussian-Polynomial-Polynomial and Gaussian-Polynomial-Linear combination using linear sigmoid gating function for LMKAD. By changing the parameters, you can obtain the results for other combination of kernel and gating function.
